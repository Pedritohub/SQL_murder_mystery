A murder case happened in SQLcity on a particular date
The task was to uncover the uncover the murderer and villain
From the police database, I had several tables to work from incliding crime_scene_report which I began with. 
There were two suspects involved, they were interviewed and one of the suspect gave a lead 
that she heard a gunshot, then saw a man run to a car but had a gym bag with him  
The bag was from a particular gym, followed up at the gym
The Hitman confessed he killed the person but gave info on who hired him to do the job
Hitman discribed the car and some part of the licence plate he can recall and where they met for the deal
This helped to follow up on dvla table n facebook_evebt table (that's where they met) 
Per the discription the Hitman gave, we could find the villain.
